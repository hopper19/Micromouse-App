# **Introduction**
*   Micromouse is a robot whose ability is navigating autonomously through a maze without user input.
*   This program allows the user to write and test their algorithms without the need of a physical micromouse.
*   It also allows the user to create their own maze, save and retrieve it, and test their alogirthms on it.

# **User Guide**
## I.   Movement
## II. 
## II. Large Maze (big canvas)
## III. Small Maze (small canvas)
*   Use RandomGuessing.py for reference on how to use the available modules. For more advanced user, take a look at ModifiedFloodFill.py
*   "MOVEMENT" IN THIS APP IS SIMPLY A CHANGE OF THE COORDINATES.
*   IMPORTANT: This app does NOT simulate physical movements, only the algorithm.
*   I cannot stress this enough. If you ever wonder whether this app imitates
  certain movements or sensing of the real bot, it probably doesn't.

*   Write your own algorithms by following the sample script BlankAlgorithm.py and the sample algorithms,  ModifiedFloodFill.py. Place your algorithm in the "algorithms" folder.
*   Make your custom maze by clicking the Custom Mode button. Set up the walls for the maze by clicking on their positions on the big canvas. To save a maze, insert a name in the input box next to the Save Maze button, then click on the Save Maze button.
