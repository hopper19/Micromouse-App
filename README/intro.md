
- Micromouse is a robot whose ability is navigating through a maze autonomously
  without user input.
- This program allows the user to write and test their algorithms without the need
  of a physical micromouse.
- It also allows the user to create their own maze, save it, or retrieve later.
  Users can also pull maze from custom mode into normal mode to test their algorithms
  on the custom maze they created.

- "MOVEMENT" IN THIS APP IS SIMPLY A CHANGE OF THE COORDINATES.
- IMPORTANT: This app does NOT simulate physical movements, only the algorithm.
  I cannot stress this enough. If you ever wonder whether this app imitates
  certain movements or sensing of the real bot, it probably doesn't.

- Write your own algorithms by following the sample script BlankAlgorithm.py and
  the sample algorithms,  ModifiedFloodFill.py. Place your algorithm in the
  "algorithms" folder.
- Make your custom maze by clicking the Custom Mode button. Set up the walls for
  the maze by clicking on their positions on the big canvas. To save a maze, insert
  a name in the input box next to the Save Maze button, then click on the Save Maze
  button.
