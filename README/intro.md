- Micromouse is a robot whose ability is navigating through a maze autonomously
    without user input.
- This program demonstrates the efficiency of the modified floodfill algorithm
    for the micromouse.
- Write your own algorithm by following the sample script BlankAlgorithm.py and
    the sample algorithm ModifiedFloodFill.py. Place your algorithm in the
    "algorithms" folder
